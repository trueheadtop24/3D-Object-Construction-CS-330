# 3-2_Assignment

One plane serves as the background for the scene, and one serves as the floor. The goal of the assignment is to add basic 3D shapes to the scene that match the scale, position, and orientation shown in one of the 2D scenes below. You may choose any one of the 2D scenes for your 3D scene replication. Make sure that transformations are being applied to the basic 3D shapes to match the selected 2D scene. You may apply your own colors to the different 3D shapes to improve the look of the scene.

Use transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation to make the replicated shapes look as close to the scene as possible in terms of scale, position, and orientation. You may also apply colors to the replicated shapes. The colors do not have to look exactly like those in the selected 2D image.

Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Create code to address the required functionality. The coding you complete in the project source code must meet the required functionality and visual representation outlined for this assignment. This result may require multiple attempts and programming strategies to get it right, but that is okay! Working in stages is an important part of any coding project.
Apply logic and proper syntax to code. Source code should be free of logical or syntax errors that prevent the application from running as expected. You will be given credit for code that is set up to meet specifications or solve the problem.
Apply commenting and formatting standards to facilitate understanding of the code. All code should be well commented. Commenting is a practiced art. Your comments should be as clear and brief as possible. Your comments should explain the purpose of lines or sections of the code. You may also include the method you used to achieve a specific task in the code. Be sure to document any sections of code that produce errors. Organize all code to meet formatting standards.
